App Name:

- Recipe Savior

## Background

As students, it always drives us crazy since we need to cook daily meals on our own. It’s too hard for us to find plenty of recipes and learn how to cook them well. To ease our daily pain, we come up with a recipe-search-and-recommend app.

## Purpose

This is a recipe-search-and-recommend app. In this app, the system will automatically recommend popular recipes for clients or get recommended recipes simply by looking up ingredients or dishes’ names. Clients can also get popular cookbooks from the system’s recommendations or build their own favorites. Ultimately, this app would become your savior if you are in trouble with daily cooking.
